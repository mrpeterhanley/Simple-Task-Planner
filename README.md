# 📆 📋 Task-Planner-Pro 📆 📋

Hi there! :wave: :smile:

Welcome to "Task Planner Pro", a web application built by Catalina Gonzalez and Peter Hanley as a group project during our Generation Australia / Academy Xi web development bootcamp from June to August, 2020. We hope you will enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!

The "Task Planner Pro" was built with Bootstrap 4.5 and Javascript, and uses the localStorage Web API to persistently store tasks you have created.
