Hi there! :wave: :smile:

Welcome to our "Simple Task Planner", a web application built by Catalina Gonzalez and Peter Hanley as a group project during our Generation Australia / Academy Xi web development bootcamp from June to August, 2020. We hope you will enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!

The "Simple Task Planner" was built with Bootstrap 4.5 and Javascript, and uses the localStorage Web API to persistently store tasks you have created.
